# cs176a
This folder will contain all projects and coding assignments for cs176a - networking.

The programs from hw1 involve a client and a server, allowing the client program to specify a destination ip and port, and connecting to the server at the location (assuming that machine is running the server program). Once connected, the client will be able to make a single command, which will be sent to the server. The server will execute this command locally and relay the output back to the client. Both the TCP and UDP server programs suppors multiple connected clients at once, and the client program can be edited to open any number of clients at once, each of which can send a different commant.
